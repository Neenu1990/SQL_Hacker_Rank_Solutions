PROBLEM 1:
Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345.
Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

SOLUTION:
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4) FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N =(SELECT MAX(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N<137.2345);

PROBLEM 2:
Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than 38.7780. Round your answer to  4 decimal places.

SOLUTION :
SELECT ROUND(MIN(LAT_N),4) FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N>38.7780;


PROBLEM 3:
Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W)where the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION is greater than  38.7780. 
Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

SOLUTION :
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4) FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N = (SELECT MIN(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N >38.7780);

PROBLEM 4:

Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

 a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1  and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

SOLUTION:
SELECT ROUND(ABS(MIN(LAT_N) - MAX(LAT_N)) + ABS(MIN(LONG_W) - MAX(LONG_W)),4)
FROM STATION;

PROBLEM 5:
Query a count of the number of cities in CITY having a Population larger than 100,000.

SOLUTION:
SELECT COUNT(NAME) FROM CITY
WHERE POPULATION>100000;

PROBLEM 6:
Query the total population of all cities in CITY where District is California.

SOLUTION:
SELECT SUM(POPULATION) FROM CITY
WHERE DISTRICT='California';

PROBLEM 7:
Query the average population of all cities in CITY where District is California.

SOLUTION:
SELECT AVG(POPULATION) FROM CITY
WHERE DISTRICT='California';

PROBLEM 8:
Query the average population for all cities in CITY, rounded down to the nearest integer.

SOLUTION:
SELECT ROUND(AVG(POPULATION)) FROM CITY;

PROBLEM 9:
Query the sum of the populations for all Japanese cities in CITY. The COUNTRYCODE for Japan is JPN.

SOLUTION:
SELECT SUM(POPULATION)FROM CITY
WHERE COUNTRYCODE='JPN';

PROBLEM 10:
Query the difference between the maximum and minimum populations in CITY.

SOLUTION:
SELECT MAX(POPULATION)-MIN(POPULATION) FROM CITY;

PROBLEM 11:
Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. 
She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.
Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actual-miscalculated average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

SOLUTION:
SELECT CEIL(AVG(Salary)-AVG(REPLACE(Salary,'0','')))
FROM  EMPLOYEES;

CEIL() : The CEIL() function returns the smallest integer value that is bigger than or equal to a number.

Note: This function is equal to the CEILING() function.

REPLACE(): The REPLACE() function replaces all occurrences of a substring within a string, with a new substring.

Note: This function performs a case-sensitive replacement.

Syntax
REPLACE(string, from_string, new_string)
